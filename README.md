# Strong Numbers

A number is called a strong number if the sum of the factorial of its digit is equal to number itself

Write a C/C++ program that accepts an integer value, N, and checks that 1<=N<=1000. The program only displays an error message if the condition is not met and terminates with a value of 1. If the condition is met, given a positive number N the program determines if the number is a strong number or not.
